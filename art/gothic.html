The French Gothic architecture is an innovative architectural style that remained popular from 1140 to the mid-16th century in France.
The great Gothic cathedrals of France were characterized by their towering height and their enormous stained glass windows.
The innovation of existing technologies developed new features such as the flying buttress and the rib vault.
Notre-Dame de Reims was built in the 13th century to replace an earlier church destroyed by fire in 1221.
Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, it is a prominent example of French Gothic architecture and has a million visits per year.
